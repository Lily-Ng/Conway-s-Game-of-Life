# Conway-s-Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life (also known simply as Life) implemented in GoLang

# About
- life.txt contains the initiate state of cells
- cells marked with "-" represents dead cells, while cells marked with an asterisk represents a living cell of the current generation
- User may enter the initial state of cells into life.txt as long as the above convention is followed

# Rules of Life
- If a living cell has 2-3 living neighbors, it survives in the next generation
- If a living cell has fewer than 2 living neighbors or more than 3 living neighbors, it dies
- If a dead cell has exactly 3 living neighbors, it revives in the next generation

# Requirements
- The state of cells for the next ten generations will be predicted and displayed

# Sample Output
Please refer to out.txt
